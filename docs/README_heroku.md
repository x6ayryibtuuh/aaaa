## Attention

 1. **Do not abuse service from Heroku or your account could get banned. Deploy at your own risk.**
 2. Aria2 & qBittorrent download speed is limited to 5MB/s on default.
 3. The Heroku filesystem is ephemeral - that means that any changes to the filesystem whilst the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. In addition, dynos will restart every day.
 4. To prevent Heroku dyno from auto-sleeping, use website monitoring service such as uptimerobot to http ping your heroku domain every 10 mins.

 3. You can connect Aria2, qBittorrent and Rclone from frontends/services running on other hosts, including flexget/Radarr/Sonarr.
 4. Auto-backup configuration files to Cloudflare Workers KV, and try to restore when dyno restarts.
 5. Execute predefined yt-dlp, gallery-dl & Rclone commands from OliveTin WebUI.
 6. ttyd web terminal, which can execute yt-dlp and other commands on the command line.

## <a id="more"></a>More usages and precautions

 1. Hit shift+F5 to force refresh if web services don't work properly. If app still doesn't work, clear cache and cookie of your heroku domain from browser.
 2. Known pyLoad bugs：
    - Redirect to http after login，solution: close the pyLoad page and reopen it.
    - Fail to delete archives after extraction, solution: Settings--Plugins--ExtractArchive, set "Move to trash instead delete" to off.
 3. After adding following content to rclone.conf file, you can use local heroku storage as a Rclone remote for manually uploading via Rclone Web UI.

      ```
      [local]
      type = alias
      remote = /mnt/data
      ```

 4. For apps which don't support custom path for qBittorrent such as Radarr, uncomment followings line in Caddyfile under config/caddy folder before deployment:

            handle /api* {       
                    reverse_proxy * localhost:61804
            }

 5. Aria2 JSON-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/jsonrpc
    Aria2 XML-RPC path： \${GLOBAL_PORTAL_PATH}/rpc
 6. It is not possible to configure a Rclone remote which requires web authentication through Rclone web UI in this app.
 7. Vmess proxy protocol: AlterID is 0, you can connect to either Vmess WS port 80 or Vmess WS tls port 443. Xray settings can be modified via content/xray.yaml file in repository. Heroku is difficult to connect in mainland China.
